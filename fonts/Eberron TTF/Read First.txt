Need an Eberron font? 

I was in this need too. So, with some copy & paste work, a lot of Photoshop, an a free font editor software, 
I was able to “clone” the Masoch Dirach font, which is the title font for Ebrron Products, and cost 30 buckets.
My version is not exactly the same, but pretty similar: the main characters – consonants, vowels,  
numbers and some signs are exactly the same, but I have to create some characters, so it is not the MD Font.

This is the first version (a final one is under development), but it work with no problems in my Windows XP, 
and I test it in Win 98 and 2K, and it worked well too. I am sharing it with a lot of people now, and you are 
the first ones to have it. 

I wish if you can test it, and give some feedback about it, so I will be able to develop a new and better version.

As long you use it only in home games, with no commercial purposes, it will be “legal”. Share it whit your friends and 
other Eberron DMs and players as you wish.

To install the font file (it is a TTF one), just unzip it, and open the following directory: 
my computer/local disk (usually the C: drive)/WINDOWS/Fonts, and copy the file there.

I hope you all like, and make a good use of it.
